Network performance is still under investigation. The discouraging part is that the performance can only reach to 90M/s even with MSG_ZEROCOPY with new iperf3.

I am feeling that better approach should be processing the data more on the A9 CPUs on the board instead of transferring the data to PC. One of example is that KiwiSDR architecture, which processes the high bandwidth data to a audio I/Q stream (10k bandwith) and a waterfall data (8k bandwidth).

So I decided to add some small applications to the firmware to try. The first application is dump1090, which already in buildroot/package. However the version in the buildroot is only support rtlsdr. So I decided to do a small porting work to make it working.

The code change is relative simple, which costs me a morning to finish the coding. dump1090 now works both from your PC or running from PlutoSDR directly.

When running from PlutoSDR directly, the CPU consumption is low (10% with 2 CPUs, 20% with 1 CPU):
